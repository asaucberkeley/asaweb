Only in the United States, **period poverty** affects about **two-thirds** of the menstruating population–most of them being low-income. Menstruation products such as pads, tampons, panty liners, etc., are not considered a basic need given legislation such as the “Pink Tax'' and the lack of free products within restrooms. Afghan refugee women are even more prone to this inequity because their community is stricken with poverty and immigration crises within the United States. 

Following the fall of Kabul last summer, the United States saw an influx of Afghan refugees. They came with little to no resources during a time of extreme humanitarian crisis within Afghanistan. While the refugees in the United States are processed in Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-hosted facilities, they lack access to necessities for their hygiene and health–making them more prone to infections and diseases that can be easily prevented. 

> The Afghan Student Association at UC Berkeley, in collaboration with the United Afghan Association (UAA) facility in Alameda, is committed to supplying Afghan women with a menstrual kit composed of pads, pantyliners, toothbrushes, hair ties, dental necessities, and translated flyers explaining California government resources available for them. We have launched a crowdfunding campaign through Berkeley Crowdfunding to raise money for purchasing the supplies.
