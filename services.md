# ASA's commumal Promise

As a team, UC Berkeley's Afghan Student Association has conducted various projects throughout the last decade. Every year, our board establishes a set of themes and our projects carried throughout the year focus solely on what we've promised. This year, President Sama and Vice President Sofia revealed our projects will center Mental Health amongst Afghans and Afghan Women's rights. We will continue to support all ideas and projects, regardless of our set themes for the 2022 - 23 academic year.
