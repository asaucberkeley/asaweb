Salaam -o- Durood everyone! I am MohammedAli, a senior studying Applied Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science. My goals post-graduation is to work in a tech-finance related position (think quant); as long as I can do math for eternity I am looking forward to it! I joined ASA because I love to work with others, especially those from the same maihan as mine. I am honored to have the opportunity to dedicate my time for the betterment of Afghans not only here at UC Berkeley, but those globally as well. My favorite Afghan dish is Kichri Quroot; I look forward to working with you all! Feel free to connect with me on linkedin and talk to me about anything!
