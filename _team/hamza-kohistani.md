My name is Hamza Kohistani and am currently a fourth year public health major. I have a habit of changing my favorite food but at the moment I would have to say Mantu is at the top. Alongside majoring in public health I am also a pre med student. I’ve had long aspirations of becoming a doctor from a young age and hope I am able to live up to those expectations of my younger self.
I joined ASA to become more connected with the Afghans here on campus. I know we all may feel lost or out of place at times but ASA is one place where we can get together and share all our cultural and historical similarities.
