Salaam! My name is Yassna Ahmadi. I'm a Senior studying Political Science with a concentration in International Relations. After graduating from Cal, I plan to attend law school to pursue a career in immigration and human rights law and policy. I truly enjoyed participating in the ASA's activities last year, especially the annual cultural banquet, where we showcased Afghan culture through dance, music, fashion, and other various forms of art. Therefore, I applied to the ASA board because I desired to have a role in advocating for our community, either by assisting Afghan students at Cal or reaching out to the greater Afghan diaspora in the Bay Area. In my spare time, I love watching international films and TV series and picking up on words in different languages. If I had to choose my favorite Afghan dish, I would pick sabzi chalow in a heartbeat.
