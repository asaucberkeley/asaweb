Hi everyone, my name is Mansoor Azizi. I am a senior transfer student majoring in Molecular & Cell Biology with an emphasis on Cell & Developmental Biology.
</br>
 I joined ASA with a purpose in building strong connections with the new generation of Afghan professionals. Along with the outlook in having fun with others through sharing our common heritage of Afghan culture. 
</br>
My favorite Afghan dish is Shola!
