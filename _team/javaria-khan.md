My name is Javaria and I’m a fourth year Political Science (International Relations) and History double-major. I hope to someday work in the legal field; I’m currently in the process of studying for the LSAT. My favorite afghan food is shorwa and shomle (doogh), so much so that I’m salivating just having to write it down! I’ve been an ASA member since my first year here at Cal. I’m now in my fourth year and I cannot imagine the opportunities and friendships I would have lost out on had I not come to the general meeting that one fateful day my freshman year. ASA has been a nurturing community for me in Berkeley, and I joined the board primarily because I wanted to share this same experience with others. I’m excited to be involved in the advocacy efforts that we have planned this year as well as the festivities and fun. Please do reach out and connect. I look forward to meeting you :)
