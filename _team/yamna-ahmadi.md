Salaam everyone! My name is Yamna Ahmadi (she/her). I’m a first-year student majoring in Public Health and intending to minor in Art History. In the future, I aspire to work for the World Health Organization to aid in combating global emergencies and public health crises. In March of 2022, I had the opportunity to exhibit and display my work of art, "Girl with the Afghan Jewelry," at the ASA’s cultural banquet. I joined this year's board to embrace my cultural heritage and give back to my community by forming a greater connection between Afghan identity, art, and design. I look forward to working with my fellow Afghan students and peers to make this a positive and memorable school year. Additionally, I have a strong passion for art history, costume design, and watching romantic comedies. My favorite Afghan dish is mantu!
