Hello everyone! My name is Sama and I go by the she series. I’m a junior majoring in Nutritional Sciences with a focus in Physiology and Metabolism and I’m on the pre-med track. My favorite Afghan dish would definitely have to be laandi-palow. I joined ASA to make other Afghan students feel comfortable on campus, by providing a safe and fun space where we can celebrate our culture. Hit me up if you need any advice about leadership or advocacy opportunities!
