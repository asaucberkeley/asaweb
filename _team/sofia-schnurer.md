Salaam, I’m a junior majoring in Political Economy with a minor in Journalism! I am tremendously excited to meet everyone and bond through what will most definitely be an amazing year!

One of my primary focuses as a board member is continuing to cultivate a welcoming and inclusive space. I’m dedicated to building and expanding our community at Berkeley. I am multiethnic (Afghan, Austrian, and mixed Indigenous/Hispanic) and find comfort in understanding my various backgrounds through food, music, film, and literature! I love to hike, practice French horn, play beach volleyball and travel.

Feel free to reach out to me anytime! I look forward to meeting you!💛

Upon graduation, I hope to enter law school, InshAllah.
