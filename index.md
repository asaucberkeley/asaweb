## **Statement against Anti-Shia movements**

ASA @ Cal is proud to honor the differences across all Afghans, whether it be religious ideals, ethnicity, background, etc. We look at these very differences to be measurements of what makes us all unique in our own way--afterall no two Afghans are the same! In recent times, the Anti-Shia vernacular has increased significantly. We stand by our Shia brothers and sisters, not obly in Afghanistan but globally; we condem all acts of violence carried through to Shias. The Shia population of Afghanistan are at risk of unfortunate crimes under the Talib government. We will continue to shine light on Shia people, Shiite Affinity Spaces alongside discussions in regards to Anti-Shiite practices, and ways we can improve our community here at UC Berkeley.
