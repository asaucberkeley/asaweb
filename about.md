## Who is ASA?
The Afghan Student Association (ASA) was founded by undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley in the fall of 2000 with the goal of assisting students of Afghan descent and expanding its mission to other regions of the United States. We are a cultural organization committed to promoting and maintaining Afghan culture both on campus and in the local neighborhood. We are committed to educating the public about Afghanistan, its people, and its culture through events like banquets, table-setting, fundraising activities, open discussions about Afghanistan, and much more.



## Organization Mission
Our mission is to preserve, promote, and embrace the cultural heritage of Afghanistan through social events, education, mentorship, and fundraising. Our members are of all nationalities and ethnicities. We are open to anyone interested in promoting our mission. If you want to be part of an exciting organization which has high goals yet a genuine and friendly atmosphere, come see what we are about.



## ASA's Goals
Our goals as an established organization here at UC Berkeley is to create a welcoming environment for Afghan Americans and serving those in the greater Bay Area region. We look to promote the culture, heritage, and betterment of Afghan society within our community as well as creating a space inclusive of all. We, the Afghan Student Association of UC Berkeley continue to expand our involvement and efforts to ensure that every Afghan is equally and appropriately advocated for here in the Bay Area.



We create a welcoming environment for all the students and alumni of UC Berkeley to interact and support one another.

## Statements by ASA Team, **Fall 2022** | Spring 2023
We understand that communal support leads long ways. While we are not an organization centered to politics, we often will release official statements in support and comradery for people. We keep a track of all yearly statements to give a sense of fraternity amongst Afghans and our neighbors.
